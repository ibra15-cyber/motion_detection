first we captured a video
turn it into gray
blured it with gaussian blur
iterated the frames and if the first is empty we made it the gray
else if its not empty continue
find the absdiff between the first frame and gray 
we went on to find the threshold of the absdiff
then finally dilated it

we went on to find contours
the condition is if a contour is more than 10000 it should continue to loop
else we bound it(object or frame captured) with rectangle
we finally define the size of the rectangle
NOTE with the face detection, someone has already written a code to do the detection
here we are trying to detect obj based on the contour

then we created a variable, status to track when an item is detect or not
0 not 
1 detected

but since it will be a series of in and out, we decided to use a list to capture in and out
we used to if command to capture when an item moves from no ob to yes 
and from yes to no

we used datetime obj created a list called time
we used this list to capture various in and out of an obj by appending now() to the condition above

we call the time list and it reported those times

then we went further
by creating a csv file to hold those times

first we import the pandas library
we create a pandas object with two col start and end
then after printing and seeing our time list
we decided to loop the list making the first timing as the start
and the second as the end

but we had to make it in a dictionary form which pandas data obj recognise
